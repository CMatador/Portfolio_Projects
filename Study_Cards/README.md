# Overview:

The study cards were designed to help those who are interested in data analyst/data engineering field prepare for the technical part of job interviews. The questions and answers were provided by Dev10 instructors and are based off the material from their 13-week-long cohorts, that covers approxiately a module a week. The user can choose to be quizzed on his/her selected group of modules, or on the entire cohort. Most of the questions are open response. The answers given on the back of the card for considered acceptable, but not meant to be used for memorization purposes.

# The Process:

A list of questions and answers were imported as an .md file and parsed through thoroughly to ensure that the questions and answers were paired correctly. Due to additional complexity of an .md file, compared to a .txt file, it was necessary to be cognizant of the additional characters, such as “*”. The module name and the corresponding questions and answers were placed into a dataframe and saved into a .csv file.
